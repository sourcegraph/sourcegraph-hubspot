   - In the Sourcegraph browser extension options menu, click the gear (‚öôÔ∏è) and enable **Experimental link previews** and **Experimental text field completion**.

If using GitHub Enterprise, right-click on the Sourcegraph browser extension icon when you're on a GitHub Enterprise page and select **Enable Sourcegraph on this domain**.

## Features

### Autocompletion of HubSpot company names

Just start typing the name of a customer in your HubSpot contacts (like `Acme Corporation`) to complete it! Select a company to insert its HubSpot URL into the text area. It works just like GitHub's built-in autocompletion for issues, PRs, and users.

This makes it easy to denote which customers care about a specific issue. (If your repository is public, no fear: HubSpot company URLs don't contain the company's name, so your customer names won't be exposed.)

### Link previews for HubSpot company URLs

For any HubSpot company link that appears on GitHub (in a comment, issue, PR, or rendered Markdown file), you'll see a preview with the company name and other stats (such as number of employees, location, etc.).

This makes it easy to see which customers care about a specific issue. The emoji link lets you see all _other issues_ that the same company is mentioned in, which is also very useful (to answer "what are all the issues a specific customer cares about?").
